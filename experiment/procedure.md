### Procedure
 Materials & Reagents Required: 
1) TLC chamber 
2)	Forceps(tweezers)
3)	Micro capillary tubes
4)	Ink sample 
5)	Mobile phase solvent: Ethyl acetate + Ethanol + distilled water (70:35:30)
6)	TLC plates
7)	Graphite pencils.

 Procedure in laboratory 
 Step 1: Prepare the solvent mixture for TLC by mixing 7ml ethyl acetate, 3.5ml ethanol, 3ml distilled water.
          Put a small amount of solvent mixture in the TLC chamber.
 Step 2: Draw two lines with a granite pencil on the TLC plate and put a ink dot on one of the line and let the TLC run in the chamber till solvent reaches the upper mark(solvent front).
 Step 3: The ink dots are separated after running the TLC. Measure the R values by measuring the distance from      baseline.
 Step 4: Calculate the Rf values for each spot.
